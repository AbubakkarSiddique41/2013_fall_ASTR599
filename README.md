Instructor
----------
[Jake Vanderplas](http://www.astro.washington.edu/vanderplas) is an NSF post-doctoral fellow at UW working
jointly between the Computer Science department's [Database Research Group](http://db.cs.washington.edu/) and
the Astronomy department's [Survey Science Group](http://ssg.astro.washington.edu/).  He received his PhD in
Astronomy from the University of Washington in 2012.  He is active in the open-source Scientific Python
community, and actively contributes to and helps maintain several of the core packages in the SciPy ecosystem.

Broad Description
-----------------
This graduate seminar course will offer a comprehensive introduction to scientific computing in Python, geared 
toward students and researchers in Astronomy.  The course is aimed at those who already have some familiarity 
with computational tools and programming languages -- i.e. who know what a terminal is and how to use it, and 
are familiar with basic programming concepts such as for loops and if-else statements -- though it will assume 
no familiarity with the Python programming language.

The two-day boot camp in the days before the start of the quarter will begin with a broad introduction to the 
basic syntax of Python: data types and operations, loops and conditionals, input and output of data, and basic 
object-oriented programming.  From that base, we will move on to a broad overview of the main computing tools 
of scientific computing in Python: IPython for an interactive computing environment, NumPy for handling of 
array-based data, Matplotlib for visualization of this data, and Scipy for common tasks such as integration, 
interpolation, optimization, and linear algebra.  In addition to this, we will introduce the use of Git, a 
distributed version control system, which we will be using throughout the quarter to keep track of code and 
assignments.

The hour-long seminar slots each week during the quarter will build upon the knowledge-base covered in the 
boot camp, and introduce more advanced Python tools such as Scikit-learn for machine learning and data mining, 
Scikit-image for pixel-level data processing, SymPy for symbolic mathematics, IPython for parallel processing, 
Cython for writing fast algorithms, and much more.  Each week will include a short 1-2 hour take-home assignment 
aimed at reinforcing the concepts covered during class.  The assignments will focus on tasks that will be useful 
in the day-to-day work of astronomical research.

While the course is designed for graduate students who are in their first year or two of research, it is also
open to any faculty, researchers or others who would like to brush-up on their Python skills.  Upper-level
undergraduates and students from other departments will also be considered on a case-by-case basis.  For
