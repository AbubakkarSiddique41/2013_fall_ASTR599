Introduction to Scientific Computing in Python
==============================================

- Jake Vanderplas
- ASTR 599, Fall 2013

ASTR 599 is an introduction to the concepts of scientific computing using the
Python programming language, and the Scipy ecosystem, including NumPy, SciPy,
Matplotlib, IPython, and other related packages.  

Course Goals
------------
This course is aimed at incoming graduate students who have some experience
with computers, but who are not necessarily familiar with the Python
programming language.  We will assume that before starting the course, 
students have some experience with:

- using the terminal for simple tasks (i.e. you should know how to use the
  ``ls``, ``cd``, ``pwd``, ``mv``, and other basic shell commands)
- writing simple scripts in a modern programming language such as Python,
  IDL, MatLab, Mathematica, C, Fortran, etc. (i.e. you should be familiar
  with variables, functions, for loops, while loops, and if-else statements)

By the end of the course, students will have seen experience with many more
advanced techniques which are vital to effective scientific research,
including but not limited to:

- The basic syntax and use of Python as a scientific tool, including writing
  and executing scripts to automate common tasks, using the IPython
  interpreter for interactive exploration of data and code, and using the
  IPython notebook to share and collaborate.
- Loading data from a variety of common astronomical formats.
- Manipulating data efficiently with NumPy.
- Visualizing data with Matplotlib
- Performing more sophisticated data mining and machine learning analysis
  with Scipy and Scikit-learn
- Tracking changes and collaborating with [Git](http://git-scm.com/)

The goal is that by the end of the quarter, an incoming graduate student with
little research experience would have the tools and knowledge to start working
in any area of Astronomy which depends on computation, either from an
observational or theoretical emphasis.

Course Schedule
---------------
The course will consist of a two-day intensive bootcamp, followed by a weekly
seminar where more advanced material will be discussed in-depth.  The boot
camp will be very hands-on and driven by short and long exercises where the
concepts will be applied to programming puzzles as well as basic research
problems

### Boot Camp Day 1
- 9:00am - 10:00am : Four ways of using Python, and when you'd want to use
  each.

  + Why Python?  Some motivating examples.
 
  + The built-in Python interpreter: Python as a calculator

  + Stand-alone scripts: Python to automate common tasks

  + The IPython interpreter: interactive Python development

  + The IPython notebook: sharing and collaborating on research

- 10:00am - 11:00am : Built-in variables and types in Python:

  + Example script: extracting data from a csv file

  + Simple types & variables: integers, floats, complex, characters.

  + Compound types and other objects: strings, lists, sets, dicts, file objects

  + functions and methods: string & list manipulation

- 11:00am - noon : Controlling the flow of a program

  + user-defined functions

  + if-else statements

  + for loops and while loops

  + try...except statements

- noon - 1pm : **Lunch Break**

- 1pm - 3pm : Introduction to version control with Git

- 3pm - 4pm : Setting up a git repository for this class.

## Boot Camp Day 2

Morning: Using numpy to manipulate data

- Afternoon 1: data visualization with matplotlib
